# This is my Shop App

This website is the first part of my project to design and build an e-commerce website with its administration dashboard.

In the weeks to come, I'll try to complete this project and start its admin dashboard.

At present, we have some of our basic components in place on the frontend.

**Next step**:

- `Design of the shopping basket (frontend);`
- `Design of the sidebar (frontend)`.

### NB: Once the frontend is finished, we'll move on to the backend.

# Languages and tools used:

Backend: Typescript, Adonis JS, Node Js.
Frontend: React JS; Material UI
RoadMap: Jira
